# 链上治理On-chain  Governance

## 概述Overview

TOP Network采用分布式的、民主的链上治理模式。

链上治理的目标是为社区成员、开发者以及矿工提供一种安全的方式更改和掌控生态系统的发展趋势。那些在TOP Network网络中有权益的人可以提交提案，然后对提案或链上参数的更改进行投票。

TOP Network employs a decentralized, democratic on-chain governance model. The goal of on-chain governance is to provide a secure way for the community members most involved, along with developers and miners, to make changes and steer the direction of the ecosystem. Those with stake in TOP Network can submit proposals, and subsequently vote on proposals or on-chain parameter changes.
