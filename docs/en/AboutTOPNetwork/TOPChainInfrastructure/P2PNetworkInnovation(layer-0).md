# P2P Network Innovation(Layer-0)

At the base layer of every decentralized blockchain system lies a means of communication via a P2P network. This base layer could be called layer-0 of the blockchain stack. Most blockchain projects do not innovate in layer-0, and instead simply reuse popular implementations of P2P networks.
Unfortunately, P2P networks have a big downside; they are not as fast or as efficient when compared to centralized networks. To overcome this, we designed our own customized P2P network architecture.
The guiding principle in our design process was to build a P2P network architecture that over time could become nearly as fast as a centralized network. This required a number of new innovations along with some tweaks to existing protocols.
