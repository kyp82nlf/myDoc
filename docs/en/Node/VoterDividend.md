# Voter Dividend

## Overview

Advance nodes can set the dividend ratio, and distribute the total rewards of the nodes to the voting nodes that support themselves according to the dividend ratio.

The total reward includes all the rewards obtained by the node, which includes workload rewards, node vote rewards, and etc.

## Node Dividend Ratio

After registering, the auditor node can create the dividend ratio of the node reward (the default is 0%), and distribute the reward from the node to the nodes that vote for it in proportion.

The node can modify the dividend ratio every 14 days.

The dividend ratio ranges from 0 to 100%. For example, when a node sets a node dividend ratio of 80%, it means that 80% of the node's reward will be distributed to the users who voted for the node.
