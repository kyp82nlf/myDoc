Nodes are also free to participate regardless of the size of their stake.</li> <li>PoS* consensus mechanism: TOP's consensus mechanism ensures that node participation is directly proportional to their stake. More your stake, more your chances of getting selected.</li> <li>Consensus nodes are randomly generated and rotated regularly to avoid network monopoly.</li> <li>The more staking made the more secure consensus.</li></ul> <h2 id="stake"><a href="#stake" class="header-anchor">#</a> Stake</h2> <p>In most PoS structure, the only factor that determines whether a node is eligible to join the network is the minimum deposit.</p> <p>TOP Network expands this concept to what we call &quot;Comprehensive Stake.&quot; Comprehensive equity considers multiple factors to determine the possibility of a node being elected to participate in the consensus.</p> <p>Factor#1: Deposit</p> <p>All nodes in the network will require a minimum deposit. Minimum deposit can be adjusted by on-chain governance. The creation initial values are as follows:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Node Type</th> <th>Minimum Registration Deposit</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>edge</td> <td>100,000*10^6 uTOP</td></tr> <tr><td>validator</td> <td>500,000*10^6 uTOP</td></tr> <tr><td>advance</td> <td>1,000,000*10^6 uTOP</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Factor #2: Credit score</p> <p>The node's contribution history is taken into account to investigate their credit or reputation. The more tasks a node completes, the higher its reputation, increasing its overall comprehensive equity. If the bandwidth or computing power of a node is low compared to the other nodes, its reputation score will decrease.</p> <p>Nodes fulfilling validator and auditor roles have their own credit points. Since advance nodes can serve both of these functions, they can gain credit score from both the validator and auditor functions.</p> <p>When you register the node, your default credit score will be 0.1.</p> <p>So, how is the credit score counted? The shards in the network routinely report number of blocks generated by each verification node and audit node to Beacon. The Beacon uses this information to update the node's credit score.</p> <p>The credit score of the validator and auditor increases with each new block. The highest score is capped at 1. After the score reaches 1, it will no longer increase.</p> <p>When a node's bandwidth or computing power lags far behind other nodes or a node commits malicious acts, its credit score will drop to the lowest score of 0.1. These parameters can be configured through on-chain governance.</p> <p>Factor #3: Numbers of Votes</p> <p>Any token holder can convert their token to votes and vote for advance nodes.</p> <p>As with any more election, the only way that nodes must accumulate as many votes as they possibly can to get elected as a block producer.</p> <p>After registering as an advance node. The election determines what role it will take.</p> <ul><li>Advance nodes are elected as audtior, archive, Root-Beacon, and Sub-Beacon. The votes obtained by the node need to be greater than or equal to the actual pledged deposit of the node (here, the node deposit is calculated as TOP, not uTOP).</li> <li>When the votes are lower than the actual pledge deposit, the advance node can only be selected as the validator.</li></ul> <h3 id="node-stake-algorithm"><a href="#node-stake-algorithm" class="header-anchor">#</a> Node Stake Algorithm</h3> <p>All nodes that need to participate in consensus have node stakes which includes auditor, validator, Root-Beacon, and Sub-Beacon.

Essentially, VRF generates a publicly verifiable random seed based on some input data and then feeds it back to the FTS algorithm. The FTS algorithm is weighted by the comprehensive equity of a node. A series of smart contracts on Beacon track the node's workload contribution, total margin, voting and any bad behavior. These values are calculated by Sub-Beacon to form a comprehensive equity, which is used in the weighted FTS algorithm.
