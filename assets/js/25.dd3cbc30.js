However, most sharding attempts thus far have only sharded in terms of computation, and not state and network capacity.\nTOP Network has developed a comprehensive multi-level dynamic sharding paradigm which shards in all three aspects. This is facilitated by the underlying network infrastructure in layer-0, along with a layered consensus network, VRF-based sortition algorithms, a two-layer Lattice-DAG data structure, and a parallel pBFT-PoS* consensus mechanism.

To prevent this,TOP Network employs dynamic sharding. Every so often, a few nodes from each shard are reshuffled into other shards. Over time, shards will have completely different nodes then they had previously. As only a few\nnodes are shuffled around at a time, consensus can continue uninterrupted while the newly moved nodes sync to the state of their new shard.\nThis same process occurs in the Routing/Audit Network as well, where Advance Nodes are continuously shuffled between Clusters.

If, for instance, only computation is sharded, then storage or bandwidth will eventually become a bottleneck.\nTo reach the goal of a fully sharded system, we developed a novel multi-layered sharding architecture.

Every user account and every smart-contract is represented by an account object. Each account object contains multiple properties, associated functions, and a mini NoSQL database. This state is sharded in two ways.\nFirst, account objects are divided between shards, meaning nodes within a shard only need to store the state of a subset of the total account space. While this already achieves partitioning of the global state,it is not quite sufficient for a few reasons. Since Validator nodes only store the state of the account subspace associated with that shard, they cannot adequately verify transactions sent from other shards unless they know that the state of the sending account was properly updated.\nTo account for this, we use table blocks, which store the latest state information of recently changed accounts. There are 1024 table blocks which are divided into the current number of shards. The account space is mapped so that each table block is responsible for an equally sized account subspace. Finding the table block associated with an account can be quickly determined using the hash of the account number. This allows shards to quickly pull relevant state information from other shards and check if balances have been updated properly before committing a transaction.\nTable blocks are also used to increase throughput by batching transactions.
